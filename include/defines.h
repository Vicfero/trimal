\details 
<b> Binary Tag Enum.</b> \n
<a href="http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/07/26/enum-flags-and-bitwise-operators/" > Alan Zucconi </a> has a great explanation of these.\n\n
 
This enum contains the tags needed to obtain sequence types by composition of its main elements.\n
 
To obtain a composed alignment type you can bitwise OR the tags: ComposedTag = SequenceTypes::DNA | SequenceTypes::DEG\n
You can Fuzzy and Exact check both simple and composed tags\n\n
 
To \b FUZZY check an alignment type you can: \n
    _alignment -> getAlignmentType() & SequenceTypes::DNA\n
        <i> This will return true if the _alignment type is DNA, ignoring the rest of tags.</i>\n\n
    _alignment -> getAlignmentType() & (SequenceTypes::DNA | SequenceTypes::DEG)\n
        <i> This will return true if the _alignment type is DNA Deg, ignoring the rest of tags.</i>\n\n
    
To \b EXACT check an alignment type you can: \n
    _alignment -> getAlignmentType() == SequenceTypes::DNA \n
        <i> This will return true if the _alignment type is only DNA. DNA Deg would result in false</i>.\n\n
    _alignment -> getAlignmentType() == (SequenceTypes::DNA | SequenceTypes::DEG) \n
        <i> This will return true if the _alignment is type DNA Deg, additional tags (like SequenceTypes::DNA | SequenceTypes::RNA | SequenceTypes::DEG) would resut in false.</i>\n\n
