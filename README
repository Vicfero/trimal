Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. 'cd' to the repository folder.

  2. Type 'cmake .' to create a custom makefile.
  
  3. Type 'make' to compile.

  3. Optionally, run trimAl/readAl with the examples into the 'dataset' 
     directory to check the correct installation.

By default, 'make' compiles the source code of trimAl and readAl in the
bin directory. After that, you can either add to PATH the bin directory
or move these files to '/usr/local/bin' or to '/usr/bin' using root privileges.
